This is the solution to the exercise in pytopia/Project-Based-Python


The task is to create a game with the following features:

    -The game generates a random number between a given range (e.g., 1 to 100).
    -The user is prompted to guess the number.
    -For each incorrect guess, the user receives a hint. The hint should indicate whether the actual number is higher or lower than the guessed number.
    -Each incorrect guess reduces the user's score.
    -The game ends when the user guesses the correct number or decides to quit.
